          <p>
            Please keep your original Driving License handy. While delivering the car to you, our 
            executive will verify your original Driving License and ID proof (same as the ones whose 
            details were provided while making the booking). This verification is mandatory. In the 
            unfortunate case where you cannot show these documents, we will not be able to handover the car
            to you, and it will be treated as a late cancellation (100% of the fare would be payable). 
            Driving license printed on A4 sheet of paper (original or otherwise) will not be considered as
            a valid document.
